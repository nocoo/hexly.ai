## 2026-09-06: Registry rewrite during release

The first release command used `bun install --lockfile-only` with the machine's temporary npm mirror. Bun rewrote 238 dependency source URLs even though no dependencies changed. The release driver was stopped before tagging, and the original lockfile was restored in a follow-up commit.

The release command now includes `--frozen-lockfile`. A temporary checkout with the package version advanced to `0.2.0` verified that this command succeeds and leaves the lockfile byte-for-byte unchanged under the same mirror configuration. Root package versions are not stored in `bun.lock`; dependency source changes do not belong in a version-only release.

## 2026-09-06: Existing apex DNS blocked custom-domain attachment

Wrangler uploaded the ready Worker but failed to attach `hexly.ai` with error `100117`. Its automatic DNS override did not replace the externally managed Vercel A record. The release stopped before tagging.

The Workers preview was verified first. The exact, backed-up apex A record was then removed and the custom domain attached, preserving the existing MX and TXT records. Public release metadata and asset checks passed after attachment. A CI job entering cleanup does not establish deployment success; check the Deploy job's conclusion and public verification before reporting completion.
